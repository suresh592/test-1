	//Executing several tasks simultaneously is called multi tasking
	
	//2 types
	
	//thread based multi taksing
	
	//process based multi tasking
	
	//Process based multi tasking
	
	//Executing several tasks simultaneously  where each task is a separate individual and independent  process
	
	//called process based multi tasking
	
	//while writing a java program in an eidtor we cnaable to listen saudio songs in the system. at teh same time we can download a file
	
	//from net. all these tasks are executing simultaneously and independent of each other
	
	//je==hence it is called process based mumlti tasking and bewst suaitable at os level
	
	//Thread based multi tasking
	
	//executing several tasks ximultaneously wherre each task is a separate independent part of teh same program is called 
	
	///thread based multi tasking and each independent part is called thread
	
	
	//best suaitable for programatic level
	
	////whether it is thread based or process based the main objective of multi threading is to improve perfromance of 
	
	//the system by dreduccing teh response time
	
	//the main important application areas of multi threading are deeloping video games, multi media graphics, implementing animations
	
	//java provides inbuitl support for multi threading by introducint a rich api(Thread runnable thread group thread local)
	
	//being a programmer we knoe how to use this apis and we are not responsibel to define that API
	
	//ways to define, instantiate and start a new thread
	
	// ****    By extending thread class and by implementing runnable interface

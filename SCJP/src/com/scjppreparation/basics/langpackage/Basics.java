	//teh most commonly required classes and ineterfaces which are required for writing any java program whether it is cimple or complex

	// sre encapsulated into a separate package called Lang Package

	// it is not required to explicitly import this package because this is implicitly imported to every jav aclass	


	///some of the clcasses of lang package are  :

	//Object String  String buffer String builder  all wrapper classes
	
	
	//Object class 
	
	//the most common methods which are required t=for any java object are eccapsulated into a separate class 	which is nothing but object class
	
	//sun people made this class as parent for for all java classes so that its methods are available for all java classes so that by default its 
	
	//its methods are bydefault avaialable to every java class automatically
	
	//Every class in java is the child class of object either directlky or indirectly, if out class wont extend any other class then only
	
	//our class is direct child class of object
	
	//if our class extend any other class then our class is not direct chlid class of object , then it extends object class indirectly
	
	//Object class defines the following 11 methods indirectly
	
	//public String toString()
	
	//public native int hashCode()
	
	//public boolean equals(Object o)
	
	//protected native Object clone() throws CloneNoitSupportedException()
	
	//public final class getClass()
	
	//public void finalize() throws Throwable
	
	//public final void wait() throws InterrutpedException
	
	//public final void wait(long ms) throws InterrutpedException
	
	//public final void wait(long ms, int ns) throws InterrutpedException
	
	//public final native void notify() throws InterrutpedException
	
	//public final native void notifyAll() throws InterrutpedException

	//Sorted Set
	
	//this is the child interfacec of set
	
	//if we want to represent a group ofindividual values according to som esorting order then we should go for sorted set

	//The six specific methods are
	
	
	//Object first returns the first element of set
	
	//obejct last returns the last element if the set
	
	//SortedSet headSet(Object O)  returns the sorted set whose elements are less than Object
	
	//sortedSet tailSet(Obejct O)  returns the sorted set whose elements are greater tham or equal to object
	
	//SortedSet subset(Object o1,Object o2)  returns the sorted set whose elements are >= o1 and less than <o2
	
	//comparator comparator()   //return the comparator object with teh underlying data structures
	
	//if we use default natural sorting order then we will gte null
	
	//teh default natural sorting order for numbers is assending order
	
	//teh default sorting order for the for the characters adn Strings are alphabetical order

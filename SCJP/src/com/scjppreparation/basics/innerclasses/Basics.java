	//some times we can declare a class inside another class called inner classes
	
	//introduced in 1.1
	
	//because of the powerful features and benefits of inner classes programers statred using them in regular code also
	
	//without existing one type of object there is no chance of another object then we wo=ill go for inner classes
	
	//example  : without existing car object then there is no chance of wheel object then we shpuld go for inner classes
	
	//  class car{ class wheel   {    }     }
	
	//without existing bank object then there is no chance of existing account object hence we have to define account class inside Bank
	
	//class Bank   {   class Account {     }      }
	
	//A map is a collection of key value pairs and each key value pair is called entry
	
	//without existing map object then there is no chance of existing entry object. henc eentry interface is defined inside map interface
	
	//interface Map   {          interface  Entry   {        .................   }         }
	
	
	//the relationship between parent to child is not parent to child. it is has a relationship
	
	
	//4 types of inner classes
	
	
	//Normal inner classess
	 
	 //Local INnner Classes or Method local
	 
	 //static nested inner classes
	 
	 //from static nested inner classes we can access only static members of outside classes
	 
	 //nonymous inner classes
	
	//from normal inner classes we can access both static and non static members of outside class directly
